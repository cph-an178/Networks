## HTTP-Exercises

### Monitoring HTTP Headers 1
I see General, Response and Request Header. Which have all kinds of infomation about what my browser request, 
what the Mavan project response is and what my browser will accept.

### Monitoring HTTP Headers 2
The connection header is 'keep-alive' which means that the browser will keep an persistent connection.

### Monitoring HTTP Headers 3
The first request is to the main web page 'studypoints.dk'.
It's the webpage I request so therefore it must be first.

The second is to 'angular.js'.
This is probaly because this javascript file is one of the first things called by the main web page.  

I got redirected from 'http://studypoints.dk:' to 'https://studypoints.dk/#/view1'

### Get/Post-parameters
With 'Get' it shows the inputs in the URL, even the hidden one. With 'Post' it does not. 

### Sessions (Session Cookies)
The session a request belongs to is identified by the URL parameter. So no matter where i paste the URL it will
say 'Welcome [Name] !'.

### Persistent Cookies
A persistent cookie resides on the hard drive of the user and is retrieved when the user comes 
back to the Web page.
